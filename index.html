		Hi, my name is Taylor Lockhart. I have a background in software development mostly pertaining to Big Data 
		while using Python. Building web applications is something I am interested in, but I don't have 
		any professional experience in web development so please bear with me. In a few months I hope this page will be full 
		of great references and material relating to Big Data, Data Science, and Kaggle.
