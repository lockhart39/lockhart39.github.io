            I've mentioned on this site before that my background primarily consists of utilizing Big Data technologies.
            In previous projects, I worked in a Cloudera environment and a lot of our processes were scheduled with varying frequency using CA7/Endevor.
            These "jobs" primarily consisted of executing multiple Python scripts that could leverage tools like Sqoop, Hive, Impala, and Spark while
            also giving the developer the ability to implement useful things like logging and retry logic.  
        </p>

            In my opinion, there are several benefits to using Python in a Hadoop/Cloud environment. I think using custom 
            Anaconda environments within a cluster is even better because you are able to leverage several helpful open source packages like Pandas, NumPy, or Matplotlib.
            Also, Spark applications can be written in Python using the PySpark API. Though, some functionality available in Scala
            may not be available if you're using Python. Though, with the newer version(s) of Spark (>= 2.3) this may be less of an issue.
